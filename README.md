# Dodgeball

## Beginning the game

Balls are placed at every other square on the middle row of the board. Players are placed in front of each ball on their respective sides. Each player rolls, the highest roll goes first. 

## Opening Rush

Each player rolls, and the higher rolling player gets the ball. A ball must be brought back to baseline to activate the ball as live. All balls must be picked up before the first ball can be thrown.

## Actions 

### Movement
Roll the dice and move that many spaces on the board.

### Pickup ball
A player directly in front of a ball can pick it up. A ball may be held for 3 turns, then it must be thrown.

### Throw
A player holding a ball can throw it (see: combat).

### No action
A player can choose to not take an action.

## Turn

A turn is completed when any two total actions are performed for your team. Actions can be any combination of two.

## Combat

Attacking player rolls dice once for distance and again for accuracy. If the distance is far enough to hit the defender, the defender rolls a die to see if they dodge, catch, or get hit by the ball. Attacker rolls first, then defender.

### Combat Results

HIT: Attacker rolls higher than defender. Defending player is out. 

Example: Attacker rolls 6, defender rolls 4.

MISS: Attacker rolls lower than defender. The ball lands how ever many spaces forward was rolled.

Example: Attacker rolls 3, defender rolls  2.

CATCH: Defender rolls same as attacker. Attacking player is out, defender keeps ball. 

Example: Attacker rolls 5, defender rolls 5.

## Winning

Once you get an entire team out, you have won that game.

## Ball position

Balls land the distance that was rolled in the direction thrown. E.g. if a ball was thrown straight ahead 4 spaces but the opposing player is 5 spaces away, that ball now sits directly in front of the opposing player. If a ball travels beyond the distance of the court it is placed back in the middle. If a player is hit, the ball drops in that players spot.
